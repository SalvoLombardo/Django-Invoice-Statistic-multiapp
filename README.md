Code Highlights


⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
AdminRequiredMixin
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
A mixin used to protect admin-only views (class-based):

from django.contrib.auth.mixins import UserPassesTestMixin

class AdminRequiredMixin(UserPassesTestMixin):
    def test_func(self):
        return self.request.user.is_authenticated and self.request.user.client_profile.role == "ADMIN"

For function-based views, a decorator version can be used:

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import user_passes_test

def admin_required(user):
    return user.is_authenticated and user.client_profile.role == "ADMIN"

@user_passes_test(admin_required)
def dashboard_view(request):
    ...


⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
Aggregations & Analytics
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
Using annotate, Sum, and TruncDate to calculate daily sales totals:

from django.db.models import Sum
from django.db.models.functions import TruncDate
from .models import Order

daily_sales = (
    Order.objects.annotate(date=TruncDate("created_at"))
    .values("date")
    .annotate(total=Sum("total_amount"))
)



⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
No Overlapping Appointments
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

existing = Appointment.objects.filter(
    date=appointment_date,
    start_time__lt=end_time,
    end_time__gt=start_time
)
if existing.exists():
    raise ValidationError("This time slot is already booked.")



⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
 Invoice PDF with WeasyPrint
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
from weasyprint import HTML

html = render_to_string("invoice_template.html", {"order": order})
pdf = HTML(string=html).write_pdf()



⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
 Admin Dashboard
⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻
A data-driven view showing summarized insights like:
	•	Total sales per day
	•	Top clients and top products
	•	Appointment frequency and user activity

All built with Django ORM and optimized query aggregation.
